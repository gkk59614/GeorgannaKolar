<p> Christmas is just right around the corner, and it's time to start thinking about gifts to give loved ones. Being a college student, I understand
the financial stress that comes from trying to find gifts at prices that wont send your bank account into the negatives (if im being perfectly honest,
mine has been in the negatives during seasons where there is no gift giving, because college). Hopefully, this website will help.</p>

<td>Using the Do It Yourself method of gift giving is the best way to save money while giving a very thoughtful gift. Do It Yourself is defined as 
 "the activity of doing or making something (as in woodworking or home repair) without professional training or assistance; broadly :  an activity in 
 which one does something oneself or on one's own initiative" 
 <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/do%e2%80%93it%e2%80%93yourself"> (source). </a> Personally, I prefer to give gifts that I make myself
 for multiple reasons. The main reason is because it shows a person you really know them because of the thought and time that went into the gift.
 Another reason is because lets be honest, creating D.I.Y. gifts is basically just crafting, and crafting can be a very fun activity.</td> 
<td>Buying gifts that show you care while still saving money can be very difficult. This is an option that is much better suited for those who
don't have a lot of free time to spend creating your own handmade gifts. If you know the person you are shopping for well, finding
personal and cheap gifts can be easy. For ideas and personalized gifts, you can browse sites such as: 
<ul>
<li> <a href="www.etsy.com"> Etsy </a> </li>
<li> <a href="www.pinterest.com"> Pinterest </a> </li>
<li> <a href="www.uncommongoods.com"> uncommongoods </a> </li>

<li><p> If the person you're making a gift for is into southern chic decor, repurposing old wood pallots into wall art is a great way to save big bucks.
It is easy to find dirt cheap or even free pallots, and you can buy wood stain and paint for very cheap prices. Depending on the look you are going
for, you can either keep the pallot as is, or pull the boards apart and resize them as you please.</p>

<li> <p> If the person you're making a gift for is a big fan of sports, self care, beer, or anything else, you can craft a gift basket full of goodies 
they are guaranteed to love. For the sports fan, you can create custom cork coasters. For the person who loves self care, you can make a variety of 
bath bombs and soaps. For the person who loves beer, you can make beer reindeer. The options are endless. </p>
